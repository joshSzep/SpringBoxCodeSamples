Code Samples
This repository contains three files of sample code I have written.

1. sample.js - this file uses Javascript/Jquery of how we react to our UI actions. It's pretty common architecture for the software system I'm currently working on. We also use SignalR library for data and UI concurrency.
2. SamplecontrollMVC.cs - this is typical .NET MVC controller that has methods to handle GET/POST requests as well responses in JSON and PartialViews for the front-end to consume.
3. SampleUnitTests.cs - One of the UnitTest classes I wrote.
